# ORCA-CLEAN
ORCA-CLEAN: A Deep Denoising Toolkit for Killer Whale Communication

## General Description
ORCA-CLEAN, is a deep denoising network designed for denoising of killer whale (<em>Orcinus Orca</em>) underwater recordings, not requiring any clean ground-truth samples, in order to improve the interpretation and analysis of bioacoustic signals by biologists and various machine learning algorithms.<br>ORCA-CLEAN was trained exclusively on killer whale signals resulting in a significant signal enhancement.  To show and prove the transferability, robustness and generalization of ORCA-CLEAN even more, a deep denoising was also conducted for bird sounds (<em>Myiopsitta monachus</em>) and human speech.<br><br>
